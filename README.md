Search all Obsidian plugins and copy text to the clipboard in the format
`_Plugin Name_(ObisdianURI|GH_Repo)`
when selecting.

Trigger is `obp`


I personally use this when helping in the Obsidian Community Discord to quickly get links.

This plugin will not be submitted to the flow plugin store as the use case is very
specific.
